try:
  regular code
except:
  exception code
 finally:
  executes after both try and except. 
------------------------------------------------------------
good practice is to not use general catch all except blocks and write an except for each specific exception
tuples can be used to specify exceptions to catch 
  example - except (ValueError, TypeError)
